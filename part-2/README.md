##  Sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000000


Write a program named `s_mult3or5.py` which sums all the positive integers less than 1000000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.

For example, the positive integers less than 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we find the numbers 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum is 23.

In this version of your program, you must use the [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) built-in data type to assist you in calculating the sum.

## Example Output
'''
$ ./s_mult3or5.py 
The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000000 is XXXXX
'''
In the sample output, the sum has been replaced with `XXXXX`. Your output must have the correct sum.
