##  Sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000000


Write a program named `mult3or5.py` which sums all the positive integers less than 1000000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.

For example, the positive integers less than 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we find the numbers 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum is 23.

The program you submit for this exercise must use a different algorithm than the one specified in part-2.

Your program should not take longer than 10 seconds to calculate the sum.


## Example Output
'''
$ ./mult3or5.py 
The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000000 is XXXXX
'''
In the sample output, the sum has been replaced with `XXXXX`. Your output must have the correct sum.
